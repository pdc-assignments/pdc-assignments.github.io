  <h2><a href="../">PDC Assignments</a>: 
         Distributed-Memory Parallel Computing</h2>
  <p>
  The assignments listed below provide hands-on experiences 
  for parallel computing in distributed-memory systems,
  such as supercomputers, Beowulf clusters, 
  or a network of workstations (NoW), 
  using the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
  In each assignment, a sequential solution is provided;
  the challenge is to use parallelism to speed up that solution.
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Circuit Solver</strong>.<br>
      Using a brute-force approach,
      find all of the inputs that cause a 32-bit
      digital circuit to produce the value '1'.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Mandelbrot Set</strong>.<br>
      Plot the set discovered by Benoit Mandelbrot.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Forest Fire Simulation</strong>.<br>
      Using a Monte Carlo simulation of a forest fire,
      find the relationships between the dryness of a forest and
      (i) the percentage of the forest that burns, and
      (ii) the length of time the fire burns.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The Pin Finder</strong>.<br>
      Using a brute-force approach, 
      decrypt an employee's encrypted personal identification number (PIN).
      </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sum of the Squares</strong>.<br>
      Using parallel techniques,
      speed up the computation of the sum of the squares of the values
      stored in an input file.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Genome Scanner</strong>.<br>
      Find the locations of a specific genetic sequence
      within an organism's genome.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>GalaxSee</strong>.<br>
      Determine what happens to a galaxy's stars over time
      using an N-body galactic simulation.
    </li>
    <li>
    </li>
    <li>
    </li>
  </ol> 
  Note that MPI solutions also run efficiently on multicore desktops
  and/or laptops--but they solve a problem using multiple processes
  that communicate through message-passing (instead of multiple
  threads that communicate through shared memory).
