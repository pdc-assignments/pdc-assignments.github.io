<h2>PDC Assignments</h2>
<p>
Welcome to <strong>PDC Assignments</strong>,
a curated collection of computer programming assignments related to 
<strong>parallel and/or distributed computing</strong> (PDC).
The goal is to provide hands-on experiences in which students 
apply particular PDC concepts and abstractions.

<h3>The Assignments</h3>
<p>
The collection currently contains the following assignments;
each assignment provides a sequential solution that the students
must speed up using PDC techniques.

<h3>Software/Hardware Platforms</h3>
<p>
Since different instructors have different technology preferences and/or
teaching environments, the following links organize the assignments by
their software/hardware platforms:
<p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <a href="./mpi/">MPI (the Message Passing Interface) assignments</a>
  can be used to explore the parallel capabilities of diverse multiprocessors,
  including single-board computers, laptops, desktops,
  networks of workstations (NoWs), Beowulf clusters, and supercomputers.
 </li>
 <li>
  <a href="./cpu/">CPU (multithreading) assignments</a>
  can be used to explore the parallel capabilities
  of a computer's multicore central processing unit (CPU),
  including single-board computers, laptops, desktops, and workstations.
  Supported multithreading platforms include 
  OpenMP, C++11, and OpenACC.
 </li>
 <li>
  <a href="./gpu/">GPU assignments</a>
  can be used to explore the parallel capabilities
  of a computer's graphics processing unit (GPU).
  Supported software platforms include
  CUDA, OpenACC, and OpenMP.
 </li>
</ul> 
All of the assignments can be completed using C or C++; 
the distributed-memory exercises may be completed using 
Java (via OpenMPI's Java bindings) or Python (via mpi4py).
