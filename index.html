<h2>PDC Assignments</h2>
<p>
Welcome to <strong>PDC Assignments</strong>,
a curated collection of computer programming assignments related to 
<strong>parallel and/or distributed computing</strong> (PDC).
The goal is to provide students with hands-on experiences in which they
apply particular PDC concepts and abstractions.

<h3>The Assignments</h3>
The collection currently contains the following assignments:
<ol>
 <li>
  <a href="">Boids</a>.
 <li>
  <a href="">Circuit Solver</a>.
 <li>
  <a href="">Forest Fire Simulation</a>.
 <li>
  <a href="">GalaxSee</a>.
 <li>
  <a href="">Genome Scanner</a>.
 <li>
  <a href="">Image Processing</a>.
 <li>
  <a href="">The Mandelbrot Set</a>.
 <li>
  <a href="">Matrix Algebra</a>.
 <li>
  <a href="">PIN Finder</a>.
 <li>
  <a href="">Sum of the Squares</a>.
</ol>

<h3>Software/Hardware Platforms</h3>
<p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="./mpi/">The Message Passing Interface (MPI) assignments</a>
   can be used to explore the parallel capabilities of diverse multiprocessors,
   including single-board computers, laptops, desktops,
   networks of workstations (NoWs), Beowulf clusters, and supercomputers.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="./cpu/">CPU (multithreading) assignments</a>
   can be used to explore the parallel capabilities
   of a computer's multicore central processing unit (CPU),
   including single-board computers, laptops, desktops, and workstations.
   Supported multithreading platforms include 
   OpenMP, C++11, and OpenACC.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="./gpu/">GPU assignments</a>
   can be used to explore the parallel capabilities
   of a computer's graphics processing unit (GPU).
   Supported software platforms include
   CUDA, OpenACC, and OpenMP.
  </li>
 </ul> 
All of the assignments can be completed using C or C++; 
the distributed-memory exercises may be completed using 
Java (via OpenMPI's Java bindings) or Python (via mpi4py).
