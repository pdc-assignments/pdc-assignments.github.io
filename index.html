    <h2>PDC Assignments</h2>
    <p>
    Welcome to <strong>PDC Assignments</strong>, a curated collection of computer programming assignments related to 
    <strong>parallel and/or distributed computing</strong> (PDC).

    <h3>Hardware and Software Platforms</h3>
    <p>
    One way of organizing these assignments is by the software platforms they use:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="./mpi/">The Message Passing Interface (MPI) assignments</a>
        can be used to explore the parallel capabilities of diverse multiprocessors,
        including single-board computers, laptops, desktops, networks of workstations (NoWs),
        Beowulf clusters, and supercomputers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="./cpu/">CPU (multithreading) assignments</a>
        can be used to explore the parallel capabilities of a computer's multicore central processing unit (CPU),
        including single-board computers, laptops, desktops, and workstations.
        Supported multithreading platforms include 
        OpenMP, C++11, and OpenACC.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="./gpu/">GPU assignments</a>
        can be used to explore the parallel capabilities of a computer's graphics processing unit (GPU).
        Supported software platforms include
        CUDA, OpenACC, and OpenMP.
      </li>
    </ul> 
    All of the assignments can be completed using C or C++; 
    the distributed-memory exercises may be completed using 
    Java (via OpenMPI's Java bindings) or Python (via mpi4py).
