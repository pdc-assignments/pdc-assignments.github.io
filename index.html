    <h2>PDC Assignments</h2>
    <p>
    Welcome to <strong>PDC Assignments</strong>, a curated collection of computer programming assignments related to 
    <strong>parallel and/or distributed computing</strong> (PDC).

    <h3>Hardware and Software Platforms</h3>
    <p>
    One way of organizing these assignments is by the hardware
    and software platforms they use:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="./distributed-mem/">
        Distributed-memory parallel computing</a>
         via the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="./shared-mem/">
        Shared-memory CPU parallel computing</a> 
        via OpenMP, C++11, and OpenACC multithreading.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="./gpu/">
        GPU parallel computing</a>
        via CUDA, OpenACC, and OpenMP.
      </li>
    </ul> 
    All of the exercises can be completed using C or C++; 
    the distributed-memory exercises may be completed using 
    Java (via OpenMPI's Java bindings) or Python (via mpi4py).
