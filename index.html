<h2>PDC Assignments</h2>
<p>
Welcome to <strong>PDC Assignments</strong>,
a curated collection of computer programming assignments related to 
<strong>parallel and/or distributed computing</strong> (PDC).
The goal is to provide hands-on experiences in which students 
apply particular PDC concepts and abstractions.

<h3>The Assignments</h3>
The collection currently contains the following assignments;
each assignment begins with a sequential solution that the students
must speed up using PDC techniques.
<ol>
 <li>
  <a href=""><strong>Boids</strong></a>.
  Visualize the flocking behavior of virtual birds called bird-oids, aka boids.
 <li>
  <a href=""><strong>Circuit Solver</strong></a>.
  Given a 32-bit digital circuit, find its solutions--all the inputs that
  cause the circuit to produce the value <tt>1</tt>
  (as opposed to <tt>0</tt>).
 <li>
  <a href=""><strong>Forest Fire Simulation</strong></a>.
  Using Monte Carlo techniques, find the relationships between
  the dryness of a forest and (i) the percentage of the forest
  that burns, and (ii) how long the fire burns before it burns out.
 <li>
  <a href=""><strong>GalaxSee</strong></a>.
  Using N-body problem techniques, visualize a galaxy of N stars
  to see how the stars' positions change over time.
 <li>
  <a href=""><strong>Genome Scanner</strong></a>.
  Find how many times a genetic sequence occurs within an organism's genome,
  and the locations of those occurrences within the genome.
 <li>
  <a href=""><strong>Image Processing</strong></a>.
  Visualize image-conversion operations such as inversion, gray-scale,
  blur, sharpen, and so on.
 <li>
  <a href=""><strong>The Mandelbrot Set</strong></a>.
  Visualize the set of points discovered by Benoit Mandelbrot.
 <li>
  <a href=""><strong>Matrix Algebra</strong></a>.
  Perform matrix operations such as addition, transpose, and multiplication.
 <li>
  <a href=""><strong>PIN Finder</strong></a>.
  Decrypt an employee's encrypted personal identification number (PIN).
 <li>
  <a href=""><strong>Sum of the Squares</strong></a>.
  Compute the sum of the squares of a dataset's numbers,
  stored in an input file.
  (The sum of the squares describes the variance of the dataset from its mean.)
</ol>

<h3>Software/Hardware Platforms</h3>
<p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <a href="./mpi/">The Message Passing Interface (MPI) assignments</a>
   can be used to explore the parallel capabilities of diverse multiprocessors,
   including single-board computers, laptops, desktops,
   networks of workstations (NoWs), Beowulf clusters, and supercomputers.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="./cpu/">CPU (multithreading) assignments</a>
   can be used to explore the parallel capabilities
   of a computer's multicore central processing unit (CPU),
   including single-board computers, laptops, desktops, and workstations.
   Supported multithreading platforms include 
   OpenMP, C++11, and OpenACC.
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="./gpu/">GPU assignments</a>
   can be used to explore the parallel capabilities
   of a computer's graphics processing unit (GPU).
   Supported software platforms include
   CUDA, OpenACC, and OpenMP.
  </li>
 </ul> 
All of the assignments can be completed using C or C++; 
the distributed-memory exercises may be completed using 
Java (via OpenMPI's Java bindings) or Python (via mpi4py).
