    <h2>PDC Assignments</h2>

    Welcome to <strong>PDC Assignments</strong>, a curated collection of computer programming assignments related to 
    <strong>parallel and/or distributed computing</strong> (PDC).
    These assignments provide hands-on experiences with different aspects of PDC, including:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Distributed-memory parallel computing via the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
      </li>
      <li>
        Shared-memory CPU parallel computing via OpenMP, C++11, and OpenACC multithreading.
      </li>
      <li>
        GPU parallel computing via CUDA, OpenACC, and OpenMP.
      </li>
    </ul> 
    All of the exercises can be completed using C or C++; the distributed-memory exercises may be completed using Java (via OpenMPI's Java bindings) or Python (via mpi4py).
