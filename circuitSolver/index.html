<h2><a href="..">PDC Assignments</a>: Circuit Satisfiability</h2>
<p>
<h3>Title:</h3>
Circuit Satisfiability

<h3>Topics:</h3>
Digital circuitry, parallel computing, performance analysis

<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
Boolean logic, parallel loops, reduction, metering, speedup, computational efficiency

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
For a given binary circuit,
the <em>Circuit Satisfiability Problem</em> is to
find and output all of the circuit's "solutions"--the inputs
that cause that circuit to produce the value <tt>1</tt> or <tt>true</tt>
(as opposed to <tt>0</tt> or <tt>false</tt>)--as well as
a count of the total number of solutions.
For example, here is a 32-bit circuit diagram: 
<p>
<img src="./32-Bit-Circuit.png" alt="a 32-bit circuit" height="475" width="800">
<p>
The 32 vertical lines at the top are the binary inputs to the circuit;
the single vertical line at the bottom-middle is the circuit's binary output.
The circuit between the inputs and output
is made up of AND-gates, OR-gates, and NOT-gates (inverters),
so we can model that circuit in software using a boolean expression
consisting of AND (<tt>&&</tt>), OR (</tt>||</tt>), and NOT (<tt>!</tt>)
operators.
<p>
This problem can be solved using a brute-force approach,
in which a for loop iterates through all the possible inputs,
and if a given input <em>i</em> causes the circuit to produce <tt>1</tt>,
the program outputs <em>i</em> and increments a counter.
After the for loop has finished, the program outputs the value of the counter.
<p>
<b>Note</b>:
To find all solutions,
the brute force algorithm must check <b>2<sup>32</sup></b>
possible inputs to the circuit.
This requires several minutes to finish on a typical Linux workstation
(and <em>many more</em> minutes if using Python).
<p>
The assignment is:
<ol>
 <li>
  Starting with one of the sequential programs provided below,
  add internal timing calls (e.g., using MPI or OpenMP's Wtime functions)
  to the beginning and end of the sequential program to measure
  precisely how long it takes to solve the problem.
  Record that time in a spreadsheet,
  indicating that it is the time to solve the problem
  using 1 processing element (PE).
 <li>
  Use parallel techniques to convert the sequential program
  into a parallel program that solves the problem.
  (Hint: Convert the for loop into a <em>parallel loop</em>.)
 <li>
  In your spreadsheet, record the raw times your parallel solution
  requires to solve the problem using a given number of PEs.
  For each PE value, calculate the speedup and computational efficiency.
  Then create three well-labelled line-charts that (respectively)
  show the relationship between the number of PEs and:
  <ol type="a">
   <li> the raw times,
   <li> the speedup values, and 
   <li> the computational efficiency values.
  </ol>
  Each chart should plot the number of PEs on the horizontal axis
  and the other value (time, speedup, efficiency) on the vertical axis.
  Depending on which parallel software option you are using (see below),
  your instructor may provide additional details regarding their
  precise expectations, such as the number of PEs you are to use.
  <li>
  Write a 1-page report in which you explain what your charts
  reveal about the relationships between the number of PEs
  and the raw time, the speedup, and the computational efficiency
  of your parallel program.
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
Using the submission process at your institution, turn in:
<ol>
 <li>
  Your 1-page report.
 <li>
  Your three charts (one per page, landscape, maximized to fill the page).
 <li>
  Your spreadsheet, showing the data used to generate your charts.
 <li>
  The source code of your parallel program.
</ol>
  
<h3>Language Options:</h3>
C, C++, Java, or Python

<h3>Parallel Software Options:</h3>
<p>
Different parallel software technologies can be used
to speedup the solution to this problem,
depending on the available parallel hardware.
The following list presents the currently supported options;
each link is to a folder containing a source program
and a <em>Makefile</em> that can be used to build that program.
Each source program is <em>starter code</em> for this project,
solving the problem using a sequential brute-force approach.
