<h2><a href="..">PDC Assignments</a>: Circuit Satisfiability</h2>
<p>
<h3>Title: Circuit Satisfiability</h3>

<h3>Topics: digital circuitry, parallel computing</h3>

<h3>Prerequisites: Boolean logic, parallel loops, speedup,
            computational efficiency</h3>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
For a given binary circuit,
the <em>Circuit Satisfiability Problem</em> is to
find the set of inputs that cause that circuit to produce <tt>1</tt>
(as opposed to <tt>0</tt> as its output.
For example, here is a 32-bit circuit diagram: 
<p>
<img src="./32-Bit-Circuit.png" alt="a 32-bit circuit" height="475" width="800">
<p>
Since the circuit contains AND-gates, OR-gates, and inverters,
we can model that circuit in software using
the boolean AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!) operators.
The sequential programs 
<a href=""><em>circuitSolver.c</em></a>,
<a href=""><em>circuitSolver.cpp</em></a>,
<a href=""><em>circuitSolver.java</em></a>,
and <a href=""><em>circuitSolver.py</em></a>
each take this approach,
solving the problem using a brute-force approach.
Each program uses a for loop to iterate through all possible inputs,
outputting those inputs that cause the circuit to produce <tt>1</tt>.
<p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>:
To find all solutions,
this sequential program must check all <b>2<sup>32</sup></b>
possible inputs to the circuit.
It requires several minutes to finish on a typical Linux workstation
(and <em>many</em> minutes if using Python).
<p>
The assignment is to:
<ol>
 <li>
  Add timing calls to the sequential solution
  to measure precisely how long it takes
  to solve the problem.
  Record that time in a spreadsheet,
  indicating that it is the time to solve the problem
  using 1 processing element (PE).
 <li>
  Use parallel techniques to create a parallel program
  that solves the problem.
  (Hint: Replace the for loop with a <em>parallel loop</em>.)
 <li>
  In your spreadsheet, record the raw times your parallel solution
  requires to solve the problem using a given number of PEs.
  For each PE value, calculate the speedup and computational efficiency.
  Then create three line-charts that (respectively) show the relationship
  between the number of PEs and:
  <ol type="a">
   <li> the raw times,
   <li> the speedup values, and 
   <li> the computational efficiency values.
  </ol>
  Your instructor will provide additional details regarding the
  precise expectations (which vary with different software options).
  <li>
  Write a 1-page essay in which you explain what your charts
  reveal about the relationship between the number of PEs
  and the raw time, speedup, and computational efficiency
  of your parallel program.
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables:</h3>
Using the submission process at your institution, turn in:
<ol>
 <li>
  The source code of your parallel program.
 <li>
  Your spreadsheet, showing the raw data.
 <li>
  Your three charts.
 <li>
  A copy of your 1-page essay.
</ol>
